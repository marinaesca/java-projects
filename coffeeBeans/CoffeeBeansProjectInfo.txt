prompt:

- 1. Consider the following problem, which (following David Gries) weâ€™ll call the coffee can problem: We have a coffee can that contains some white beans and some black beans. We perform the following operation on the beans:

- Until no further beans can be removed do: 
- 1. Randomly choose two beans. 
- 2. If the two beans are the same color, then throw both of them away and add a new black bean. 
- 3. If the two beans are different colors, then throw away the black one and return the white one to the can.
